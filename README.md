# Covid

Covid 19 is a completely unprecendented event in our lifetime. On a global level, hundreds of thousands of people have died and more than a million infected. But what about the small level, our neighbourhoods? 

This project aims to survey one local neighbourhood (Sant Antoni) in Barcelona, to capture business closures during 2020. Many of my local businesses don't even appear on googlemaps - how did they survive the pandemic, or did they? This project is interested in *hidden data* - that which can only be captured in the time-honoured John Snow tradition of surveys. My starting hypothesis is that certain kinds of businesses, and especially those which do not appear on googlemaps, were more vulnerable to closure. They were less able to, for example, pivot to online selling because of their lack of online prescence. 

The first step is to literally obtain the data. I will first explore different ways to capture the information (co-ordinates, business name, status, business type etc), and do a test of a small part of the neighbourhood to uncover any issues.
